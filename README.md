Welcome to my world! 🌟.

Hello there! My name is Shahad Adel, and I am currently a junior AI major exploring the intriguing world of artificial intelligence. I'm fascinated by the secrets of machine learning and data analysis and the limitless possibilities they provide for changing how we interact with our surroundings.

🚀 About Me. 

I'm a student with a passion for all things AI. I'm always learning new things and using machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts to address problems in the real world. My academic career has been enhanced by my active involvement in many hackathons, such as the Quran Hackathon and the Education Hackathon, where I took on the task of using AI to address urgent problems in education and interact creatively with the Quran. In addition to hackathons, I participate actively in several university communities, which contribute to developing a community among people who have a strong interest in innovation and technology. Through my engagement, I've been able to acquire a broad range of skills, including effective communication, leadership, and teamwork—all of which are crucial in the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence.

🌐 My Interests.

- **Machine Learning:** investigating different machine learning models, comprehending their internal mechanisms, and using them to solve real-world issues.

- **Data Analysis:** Delving into datasets, cleaning, manipulating, and extracting valuable information that can guide decision-making processes.

- **Deep Learning:** Deep neural network experimentation, particularly for computer vision and natural language processing applications.

- **AI Ethics:** Having conversations and conducting research on the moral implications of AI and the responsible development of technology.
